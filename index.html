        <p>My name's Atravias
            and I'm interested in computer programming and business management. I like to
            play guitar,
            play
            games, play sports, go to the gym, eat food, and find new places to eat food. I like to have fun but get
            things done
            while I do. Some people may describe me as fun, adventurous, or creative. Others may call me wreckless,
            loud, yet funny.
            The majority of people I meet I tend to get along with, so I assume I'm doing something right.
            I've been working ever since my first job at 17, and nothing has stopped me from making my own journey.
            I
            never wanted
            to stop looking for what I wanted to do, and when I found out about computer programming, I wanted to
            learn
            it, and
            after trying out a few things online, I enjoyed doing it! It seemed like a skill that would benefit me
            in my
            future, so
            I decided to give it a shot when I found a class online through the University of utah.
            I am currently enrolled in a computer programming class with the University of Utah and learning new
            skills
            every week.
